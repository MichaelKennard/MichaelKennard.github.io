<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in New Hartford New York</h2>
<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it set up properly. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Nearly all makes can figure out the age of a water heater from the design and identification number. Have a licensed plumber identify whether it's up to current code and securely working. Ask the plumber to examine and document the size of the hot water heater when they're out to perform the inspection, and whether it fulfills the needs of the house.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most terrible and prevalent water problems: tough water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day house. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life-span of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines. Hard water damages hot water home appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
