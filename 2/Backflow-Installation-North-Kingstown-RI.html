<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
