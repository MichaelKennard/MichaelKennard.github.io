<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
