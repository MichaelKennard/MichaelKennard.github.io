<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
