<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
