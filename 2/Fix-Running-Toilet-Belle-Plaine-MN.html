Reconnect the trigger plug wire.

<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
