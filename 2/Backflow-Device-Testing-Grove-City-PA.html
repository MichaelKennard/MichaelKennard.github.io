The waste disposal unit is among the most misused home appliances in the whole house. Couple of homeowners understand that a disposal is created specifically to manage food residue washed from a plate-- not whole chunks of leftovers! Big quantities of food can quickly overwhelm the system and cause an extensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives a lot of phone calls asking for waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically salt. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>

Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a price quote over the phone.

<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is an essential kitchen home appliance in most houses today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can manage almost any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the threat of drain clogs.</p>
