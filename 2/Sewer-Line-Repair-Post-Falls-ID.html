It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
