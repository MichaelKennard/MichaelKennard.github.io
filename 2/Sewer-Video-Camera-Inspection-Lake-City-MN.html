<p>Spotty dishes? Distribution pipes transition to even smaller sized individual service pipes, carrying water to individual houses, house structures, services and stores. Depending upon need, these pipes range in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches.

<p>Often a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the concern if this is the case. You might need to check out using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. There are two basic piping materials used by plumbing experts.
