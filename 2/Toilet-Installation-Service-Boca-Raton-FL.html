<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water. This can require the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible contaminants can then go into the safe and clean water system. The best way to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Other indications you may need to repipe include rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily mean repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to figure out the best course of action.</p>
