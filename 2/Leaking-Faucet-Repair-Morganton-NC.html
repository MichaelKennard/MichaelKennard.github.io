<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

In either case, scalding water threatens and should be instantly dealt with by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
