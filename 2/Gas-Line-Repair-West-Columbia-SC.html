<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating West Columbia SC</h3>

When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, become much heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment procedure. Versatile gas lines are generally preferable to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection between the supply and home appliance.
