<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
