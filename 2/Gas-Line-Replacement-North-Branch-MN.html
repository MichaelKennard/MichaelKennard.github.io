Possibilities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was constructed decades prior to that.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
