<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant costs can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for residents. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer features two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back and back siphonage pressure on non-health risk (low threat) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that links the supply line. Hold its base with a locking pliers if the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank. Idea: Toss a towel on the floor below to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
