In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly.
