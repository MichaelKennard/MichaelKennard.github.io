Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the newly cleaned main drain. By including perseverence and patience the job was done to my total fulfillment.</p>
