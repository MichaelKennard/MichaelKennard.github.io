<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Virginia Beach VA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to determine and repair the drain issue. This type of camera is particularly helpful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
<p>The simplest service may seem to be merely ignoring the problem or utilizing a do it yourself chemical solution. However, this is a momentary fix and might trigger more damage. Some pipe materials, like copper or cast-iron, are sensitive to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can corrode and erode your pipes, causing significant leaks, fractures, and large damages.</p>

We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

We find that repiping can really be the cheaper and better long-lasting option if you do have regular leakages.</p>
