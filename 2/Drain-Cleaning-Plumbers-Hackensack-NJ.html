<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
