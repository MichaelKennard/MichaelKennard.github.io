<p>When deciding on the proper system security there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world.

Fire security system are developed to match the risk that exists in the places they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be developed and installed to fulfill that specific risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a very various fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
