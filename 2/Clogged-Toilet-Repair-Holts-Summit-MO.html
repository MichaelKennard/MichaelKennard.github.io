<p>The next step we should perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to ensure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
<p>Poorly set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task.
