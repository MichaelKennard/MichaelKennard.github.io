The reasons for this can vary from leakages, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating component or thermostat.

The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
