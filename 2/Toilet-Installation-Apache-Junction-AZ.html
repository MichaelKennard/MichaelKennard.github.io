If your water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Apache Junction AZ</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
