<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has needed multiple repairs over the last few years. A great rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: because the life expectancy of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>So Professional!!!! I am so amazed with this company. They reacted to a hot water heater concern at my service within thirty minutes of me calling. I would suggest Marin WATER for any plumbing problem. They are educated and incredibly professional. Drainage and pipes damage could be triggered by nails, screws, and other fasteners.
