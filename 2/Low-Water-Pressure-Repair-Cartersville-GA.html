<p>Hidden water leaks are frequently demanding and have Possibly Severe Consequences. Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3).

To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
