<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal unit will need can vary depending on how typically it's utilized, its age, and the kind of items you're putting in it. Make sure to run it frequently to keep it clear and always run water before and after utilizing it, as well as throughout for constant feeds.

To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your entire house when you identify a leak.</p>
