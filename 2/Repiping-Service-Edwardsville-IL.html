These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
