<p>The average life span of an electrical water heater is more than that of a gas one. Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house.</p>
<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to release and open water to the outside if either check valve need to leak. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
