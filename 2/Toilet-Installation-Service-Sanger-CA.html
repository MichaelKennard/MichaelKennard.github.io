<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and deterioration.

<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right now and often those leaks come days or weeks later.
