A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely broken and just requires to be replaced.</p>
