Please have your authorization number and three-digit inspection code ready. Inspections might be set up until 8 p.m. for the next day.</p>
<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. There's an excellent opportunity that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
