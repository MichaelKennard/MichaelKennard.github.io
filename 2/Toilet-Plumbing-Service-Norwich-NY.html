<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Sometimes drain repair requirements can be solved relatively rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be disassembled, taken a look at, and cleared prior to being replaced.
