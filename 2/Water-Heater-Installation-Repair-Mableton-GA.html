<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Therefore, considering all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
