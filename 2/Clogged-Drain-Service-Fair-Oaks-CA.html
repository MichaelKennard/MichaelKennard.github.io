<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Call us and let us help figure out if it's time for a new water heater installation if you observe any of these signs. The typical labor cost to install a gas line is $3 to $11 per linear foot depending on the size of the pipe and task complexity. Licensed plumbers charge between $45 to $150 per hour, or $100 an hour on average to put new gas lines.</p>
<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, courteous, proficient. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also had to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's abilities. We decided to stay with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter prices were definitely on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life-span of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice makers.
