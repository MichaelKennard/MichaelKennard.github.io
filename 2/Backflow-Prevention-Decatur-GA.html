<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
