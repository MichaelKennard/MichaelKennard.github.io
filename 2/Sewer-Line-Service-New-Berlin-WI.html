<p>The Battelle Research study also discovered tough water to rapidly lead to clogged shower heads, sometimes after just a year and a half of routine usage. After just one week of continuous testing with tough water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to lab outcomes. Shower heads utilizing water dealt with by a water softening system, on the other hand, carried out nearly as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
<p>Water softeners been available in all shapes and sizes and bigger definitely does not indicate better. WaterBoss ® uses fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that in fact supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we don't need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that allow a churning of resin during regrowth to launch dirt, hardness and sediment.</p>
