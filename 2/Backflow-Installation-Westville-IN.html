<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Westville IN</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
