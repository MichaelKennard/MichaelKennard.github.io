Prolonged service warranty: Many disposals come with at least a 1-year service warranty, but if you buy one with a life time service warranty (15+ years), it will probably be more expensive. While there's not a specific timetable regarding when you must repipe your home, you must absolutely look into repiping if they haven't been performed in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>While lots of water heater problems can be successfully fixed, some concerns will require total water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its normal life expectancy (normally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
<p>When a leak develops under the structure of your home or in walls behind bath tubs and vanities it is often a better option to merely replace the entire damaged water system. At Rainaldi, we are specialists in repiping. We've effectively repiped thousands of Central Florida properties with very little interruption, and desire you to understand that no task is too big, or too little. We understand the damage and disappointment a leak can cause, please ask us about water extraction and removal services.</p>
