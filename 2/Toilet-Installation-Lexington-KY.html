<p>A clogged drain is another typical repair - generally with sinks. In many cases, a sink drain problem is caused by excessive impurities or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care products or soaps. While there are several chemical drain cleaning options, often this can cause more damage than aid. Anytime you find a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to diagnose the concern and recommend the best repairs.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are an essential function in any contemporary kitchen. If you live in an older house, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's likewise possible for a disposal to suddenly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to breaking.

If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
