<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to providing an extensive line of backflow preventers, the majority of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing fixtures satisfy and go beyond the standards established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Current modifications to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing components, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly intended for human water intake are required to be produced with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have actually been designated lead-free," implying they are certified.</p>

If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
