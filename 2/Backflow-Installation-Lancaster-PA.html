You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
