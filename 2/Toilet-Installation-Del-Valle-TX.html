<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Del Valle TX</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
