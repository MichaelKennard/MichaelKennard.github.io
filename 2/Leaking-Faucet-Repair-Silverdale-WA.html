<p>Providing quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are safe, however with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
