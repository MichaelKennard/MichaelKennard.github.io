Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental regulations. Local building regulations for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can take place, preventing polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to avoid backflow range from the relatively basic to the very sophisticated and complex.</p>
