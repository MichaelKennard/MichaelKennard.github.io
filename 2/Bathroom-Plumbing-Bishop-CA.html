Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are released into the water.

<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust.
