<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Corrales NM</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>All devices or systems provided by safe and clean water lines that may go through contamination must have airgaps (Ct. Regs. ยง 19-13-38a( b )). These include equipment such as washing tanks, pesticide and herbicide holding tanks or components used to consist of solutions of chemicals.
