<p>Traditional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and after that launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you surpass a predetermined level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
