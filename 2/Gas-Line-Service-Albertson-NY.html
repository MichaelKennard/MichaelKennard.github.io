<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
