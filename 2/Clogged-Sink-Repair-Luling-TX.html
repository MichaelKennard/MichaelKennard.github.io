<p>Since of a problem at the point of installation or since of maintenance, water softeners leaks are mostly caused. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced with time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely split and simply needs to be replaced.</p>
