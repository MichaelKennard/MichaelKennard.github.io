<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Lawrenceburg IN</h3>
<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in families and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, as well as enhancing present reverse osmosis treatment systems.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
