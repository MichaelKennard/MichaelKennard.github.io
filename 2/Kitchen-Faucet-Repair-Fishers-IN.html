<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Fishers IN</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does happen more frequently than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
