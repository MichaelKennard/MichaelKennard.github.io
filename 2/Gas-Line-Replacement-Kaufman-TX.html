For the more severe clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more severe is incorrect with them.</p>
