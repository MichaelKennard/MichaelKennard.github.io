<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
