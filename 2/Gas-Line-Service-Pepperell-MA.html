<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
