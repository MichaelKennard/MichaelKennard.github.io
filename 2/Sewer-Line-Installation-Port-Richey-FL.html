<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion.

Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched.
