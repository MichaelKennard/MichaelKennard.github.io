<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up.

<p>The system has gone back to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way.

When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
