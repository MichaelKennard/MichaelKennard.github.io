ABS and PVC are not really glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>

Often it might be needed to filter the water prior to it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to maker instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
