<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water demands of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
