<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The brine solution need to be blended and saved in the brine tank. Regular obstructing of the resin also requires special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, bacteria and fungis likewise form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. However, check out the manufacturer's guidelines before adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
