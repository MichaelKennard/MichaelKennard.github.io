<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>To prevent these things from blocking your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons advises that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These nifty additions to your sinks and tubs can minimize the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drainpipes. Many garbage disposals will need a brand-new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink along with a brief length of pipe that extends listed below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as outlined below. Both will develop a good seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
