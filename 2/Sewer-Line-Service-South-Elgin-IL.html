<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more significant costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for citizens. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
