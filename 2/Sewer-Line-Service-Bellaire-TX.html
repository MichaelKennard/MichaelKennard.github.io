<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Bellaire TX</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens since the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to extensive residential or commercial property damage. Keep an eye out for damp, green spots in your backyard, a consistent sewage smell in or around your home, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>The sewer line in your home is a huge part of your home's plumbing. Your sewer line is part of your water system that carries out all water and waste from your sinks, drains, and toilets.
