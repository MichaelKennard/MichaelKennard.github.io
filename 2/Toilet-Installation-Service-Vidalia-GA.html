<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your property.

We recommend you go with drain snaking instead of using strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners may do more damage than excellent by corroding your pipes.</p>
