This can cause low circulation concerns or perhaps stop a component from streaming entirely.

<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily triggered because of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. If the bypass valve is split, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and simply needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
