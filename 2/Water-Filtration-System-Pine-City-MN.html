When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
