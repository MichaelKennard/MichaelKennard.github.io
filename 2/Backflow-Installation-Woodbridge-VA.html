Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of hazardous contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment containing a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection.
