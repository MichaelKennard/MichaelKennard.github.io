Position the disposal so that the discharge tube lines up with the sink drain waste trap and guarantee all connections are tight.</p>
<p>Among the most serious water heater problems is leaking water, which is often triggered by malfunctioning temperature and pressure (T&P) relief valves.

<p>The system has returned to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is avoiding the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This permits pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
