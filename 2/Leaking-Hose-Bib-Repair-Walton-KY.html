<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Walton KY</h3>
<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" style softener, making it a reliable and hassle-free  system for your house. Friendly, well-informed technician. He got our drain cleared out in a really efficient and professional  manner. I would not hesitate to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements. Toilet Runs Intermittently - Don't you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It generally means there is a concern with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water somewhere.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
