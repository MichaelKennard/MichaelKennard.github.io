<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
