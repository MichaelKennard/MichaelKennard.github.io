Heating water accounts for up to 20 percent of the average home's energy budget plan. Some gas-fired tankless hot water heater declare to cut energy expenses by as much as half. But their added up-front costs mean it pays to look before you jump.</p>

<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is essential to determine the precise place of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
