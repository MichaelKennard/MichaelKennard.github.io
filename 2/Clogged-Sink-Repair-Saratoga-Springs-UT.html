<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up effectively, you might experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
