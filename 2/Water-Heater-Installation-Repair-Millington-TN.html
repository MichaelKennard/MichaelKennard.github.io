<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. The water in the toilet bowl drops.

<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between man and machine.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, ensuring your journey lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those small everyday troubles - that the majority of people just live with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>
