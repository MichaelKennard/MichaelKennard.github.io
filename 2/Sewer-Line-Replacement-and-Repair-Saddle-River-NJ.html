<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
