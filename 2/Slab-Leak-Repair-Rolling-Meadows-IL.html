Fire protection system are designed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be created and set up to satisfy that specific hazard or need. An airplane hangar will need an extremely various fire security system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
