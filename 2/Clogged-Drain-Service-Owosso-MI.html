<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>When selecting the appropriate system protection there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be looked at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the risk that exists in the places they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to fulfill that specific threat or need. An airplane hangar will need a really various fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
