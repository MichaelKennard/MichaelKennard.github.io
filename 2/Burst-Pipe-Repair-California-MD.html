<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can attain this.</p>
