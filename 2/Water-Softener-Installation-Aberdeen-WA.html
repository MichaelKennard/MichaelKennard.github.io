<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Aberdeen WA</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has area to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As difficult water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the hardness minerals have a greater positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
