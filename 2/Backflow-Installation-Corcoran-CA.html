<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what occurs when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs since the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots.
