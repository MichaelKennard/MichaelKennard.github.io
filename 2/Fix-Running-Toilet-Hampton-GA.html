This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain issue. This kind of camera is especially useful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system.</p>
