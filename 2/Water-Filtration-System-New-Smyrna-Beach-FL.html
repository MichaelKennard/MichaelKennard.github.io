<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is thought about a testable backflow preventer, but it is also really unusual. They were produced so as to give the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. When it comes to the danger, this device covers dangerous as well as non-hazardous situations. However simply as with the AVB it can not handle back pressure, just back siphonage.</p>
<p>We provide fast, exact same day service and will send out a qualified professional to your home or service and do our best to make sure that you have hot water again as quickly as possible.
