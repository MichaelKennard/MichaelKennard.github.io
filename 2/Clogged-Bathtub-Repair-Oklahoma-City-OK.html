<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Oklahoma City OK</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous desired usages around your house.</p>
