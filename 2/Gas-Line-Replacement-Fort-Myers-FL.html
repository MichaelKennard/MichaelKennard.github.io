<p>Supplying quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions likewise allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, however over time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
