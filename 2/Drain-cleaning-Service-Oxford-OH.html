<p>Some plumbers charge more for their services than others, but that's usually an indicator of their quality. Normally speaking, more experienced plumbers will charge more for their services. Tankless hot water heater eliminate the long wait for heat of the standard hot water tank. Plumbing pipes, like everything else, wear out gradually. Usually, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too comprehensive for repair.
