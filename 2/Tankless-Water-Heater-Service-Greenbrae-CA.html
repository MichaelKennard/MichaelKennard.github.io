<p>The toilet takes an actually very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of decreased pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never ever takes place.</p>
<p>Backpressure may happen when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
