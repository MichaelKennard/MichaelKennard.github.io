<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
