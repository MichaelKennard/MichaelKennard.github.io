Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
