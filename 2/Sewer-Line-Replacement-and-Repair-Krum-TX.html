It prevails for a toilet to have actually broken parts eventually which causes the toilet to run. When someone says a toilet is running, what they indicate is the toilet won't stop running. This is normally due to worn flapper valve, however a couple of other common problems are the fill valve and the overflow tube.</p>

The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the issue.

Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
