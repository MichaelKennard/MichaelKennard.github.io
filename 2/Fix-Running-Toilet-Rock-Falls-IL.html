That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than repaired.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
