<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
