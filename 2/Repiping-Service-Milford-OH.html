<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are safe, however with time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

This added with other debris in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
