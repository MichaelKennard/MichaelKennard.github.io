<p>To prep your system for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>If you're like most people, you have actually never even thought of it, however flushing your hot water heater can help it last longer and might save you money on energy costs by bring back the effectiveness of the hot water heater. Your hot water heater ought to be flushed once a year. If you have a 15‐year‐old hot water heater that's never ever been flushed, it may have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank. That implies eight fewer inches of warm water, not to point out the reality that your faucet water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
