<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
