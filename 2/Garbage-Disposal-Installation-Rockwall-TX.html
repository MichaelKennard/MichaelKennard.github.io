By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to provide some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.

When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, along with examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
