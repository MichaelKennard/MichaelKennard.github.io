<p>The toilet takes an actually long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of reduced pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outside, making sure backflow never ever happens.</p>
<p>Difficult water causes a higher danger of lime scale deposits in household water supply. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for instance, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>
