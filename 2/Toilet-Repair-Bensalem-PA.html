Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our customers is kept devoid of damaging pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment including a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can occur through a process called backflow.</p>
