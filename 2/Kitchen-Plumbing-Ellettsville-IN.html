<p>The toilet takes a truly long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and release water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never ever takes place.</p>

After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed.
