<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
