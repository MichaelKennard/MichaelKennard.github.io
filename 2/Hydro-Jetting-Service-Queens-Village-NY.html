<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. An RPBA works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to separate health or non-health dangers.</p>
<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will periodically release percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
