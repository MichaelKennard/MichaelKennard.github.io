For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to work correctly. With electrical models, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and devastating water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water damaged the modern home. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the lifespan of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice machines. Tough water ruins warm water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
