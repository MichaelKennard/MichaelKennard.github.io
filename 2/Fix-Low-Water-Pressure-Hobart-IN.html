<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to obtain a plumbing permit prior to replacing a backflow or setting up preventer. Provided there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial hot water heater can be repaired, however is it worth repairing? Only after answering the following questions must you respond to repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your water heater is? Do you understand how many years it's ranked for? Consider replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for.</p>

In all severity however, making sure your trip lever is working well can conserve you the trouble of those little everyday troubles - that many people just deal with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>

With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain.
