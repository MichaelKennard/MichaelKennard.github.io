<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
