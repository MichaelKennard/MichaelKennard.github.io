<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then get in the drinkable water supply. The very best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and corrodes internally. When drawing water from galvanized pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other pollutants flow into your drinking water. These pollutants also clog the pipe internally stopping the flow of water to components.
