<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture moisture and sediment so that they don't enter the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap may be consisted of in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention gadgets to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might permit tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These devices undergo testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they go through routine tests later on, as well.</p>
