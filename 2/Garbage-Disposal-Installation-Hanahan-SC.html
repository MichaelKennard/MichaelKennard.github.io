<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>

All assemblies should be protected from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used. Seek advice from makers specifications for suggestions. When looking for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>
