<p>Backflow preventers must only be repaired when the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
