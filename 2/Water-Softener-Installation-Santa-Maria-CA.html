I have actually been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Corrosion can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The impact of rust on a metal alloy need to be evaluated to determine if the part is usable or must be replaced.</p>
<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of minimized pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is created to release and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
