If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your home's foundation, the best you can hope for is to find out quickly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out below your house, a sinkhole will cause the foundation to shift and establish fractures. In this case, you'll need professional plumbers as well as structure repair professionals.</p>
<p>A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
