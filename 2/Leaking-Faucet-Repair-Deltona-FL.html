<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
