<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they do not get in the control system. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices go through testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they undergo regular tests later on, also.</p>
