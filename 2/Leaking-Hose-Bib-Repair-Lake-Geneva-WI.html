<p>Natural gas is a clean-burning and affordable  technique to running appliances and heating houses. There are still some drawbacks, however, as a gas leak can cause damage to your house, lead to health threats and even worse. To appropriately maintain your gas lines, you need to have them regularly inspected by a licensed plumber to help recognize and repair any rust and leakage that could be triggering unsafe conditions.</p>
<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
