You may end up doing more harm than great if you continue to combat with it, which can create long-term problems. If you do not have a skilled appearance into your clog circumstance, sewage back-flow is another major concern.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can attempt dumping a tray of ice down the drain, and then turn on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it also. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No issue is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing team finishes the job rapidly and economically.</p>
