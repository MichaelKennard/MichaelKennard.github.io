<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
