<p>The next action we must carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to guarantee the line is properly flushed.</p>
