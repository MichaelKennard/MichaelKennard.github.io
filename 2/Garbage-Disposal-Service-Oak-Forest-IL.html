<p>Badly set up gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating and cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
