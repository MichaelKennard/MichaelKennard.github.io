For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up because you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the clog and send it down the pipes. We suggest you select drain snaking rather of using strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners might do more damage than excellent by corroding your pipes.</p>

However very first link the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and check for leakages. If you find any problems, leaving the bolts uncut up until you've done these final checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and remove.</p>
