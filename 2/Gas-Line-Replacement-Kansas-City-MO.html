<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber Kansas City MO</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention remains in location to secure our drinking water throughout the watering season. Denver Water will send out a testing reminder notice 30 days before the yearly test is due.</p>

Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from harmful contaminants.
