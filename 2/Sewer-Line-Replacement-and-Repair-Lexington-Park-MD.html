<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lexington Park MD</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line clogs are not something a house owner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this kind of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially beneficial in locating a problem.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are 2 various kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on an accreditation test, I discuss them only.</p>
