<p>As a VITAL SERVICES COMPANIES, we remain OPEN and available to help with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, a/c or electrical needs. The garbage disposal is one of the most misused appliances in the entire house. Couple of homeowners realize that a disposal is designed specifically to handle food residue rinsed from a plate-- not whole pieces of leftovers! Big amounts of food can quickly overwhelm the system and cause a comprehensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets so many telephone call asking for waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
