<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak right away and sometimes those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be effectively re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
