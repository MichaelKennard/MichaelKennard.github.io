<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic style of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least expensive, but likewise the least reliable option. These devices are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one must be set up at every control valve.

The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and advanced backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow range from the relatively simple to the complex and really sophisticated.</p>
