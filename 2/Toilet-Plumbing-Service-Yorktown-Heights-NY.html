<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Yorktown Heights NY</h3>

Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time in between charging cycles depends upon the solidity of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to remove hardness.</p>
<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this could clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you permit your unit to go empty of one kind of salt before including another to avoid the incident of any problems.
