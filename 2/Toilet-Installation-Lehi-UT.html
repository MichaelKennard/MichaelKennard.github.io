<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>
