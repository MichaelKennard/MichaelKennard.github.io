<p>When selecting the proper system security there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are designed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be created and installed to meet that particular risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely various fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would likewise vary considerably.</p>
