A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve.

<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll observe that water goes to fill up the bowl. However, in an appropriately working toilet, the water needs to stop running once the bowl is filled to its appropriate capability. Opportunities are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are extremely wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can attain this.</p>
