<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the typical direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Decreased Pressure.

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
