<p>We are an insured and licensed drain cleaning contractor who can clear out hard drain obstructions and leave them working like new once again. The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per linear foot. Total costs range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping required to link to the main gas supply, which usually averages 30'.</p>
<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
