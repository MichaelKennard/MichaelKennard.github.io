<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and hot water heater repair from physical damage such as leaks or cracks are also typical incidents. Kenny came out and did an amazing job unclogging my storm drain. He diagnosed the problem and was able to come back and jet it out. Saved me the time and money of ripping it all out and changing it. He provided recommendations to assist in the future, was very professional, and will be used again if need be. Extremely recommended.</p>
