<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house. Even if the issue comes from with the local system, it's still smart to generate the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can save you money and time as well as protect your health in the future. After softening a large quantity of tough water, the exchange medium ends up being coated with calcium and magnesium ions. When this occurs, the exchange medium need to be charged or regrowed (Figure 1).
