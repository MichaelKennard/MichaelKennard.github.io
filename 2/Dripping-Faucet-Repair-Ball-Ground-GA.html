If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary blockages further down the water lines.

<p>Energy Performance. Selecting a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is recommended. The energy performance of a storage water heater is indicated by its Energy Aspect (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the greater the EF ranking.

<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Ball Ground GA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can vary in between 2 and ten years. Since the average lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may want to acquire an extended warranty. Most warranties cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To prevent more breakdowns, house owners must keep up with regular maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the overall expenses. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
