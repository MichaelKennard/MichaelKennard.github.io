<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies East Rochester NY</h3>
<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of factors, consisting of poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and rust. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
