<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor El Cajon CA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be needed to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both locations. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer checked on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
