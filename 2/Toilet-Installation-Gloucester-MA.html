<p>Water softeners remove problems caused by tough water inside your house. Not all water is hard, but you understand if you have it. Liquified minerals found in difficult water can clog drains, develop scale in pipes, and make your devices less effective. It also affects the quality of your laundry and the lather of soaps in your showers. You can resolve these problems by including a water softener system to your house.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
