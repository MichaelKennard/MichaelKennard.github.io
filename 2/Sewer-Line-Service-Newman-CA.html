<p>The main distinction amongst water softener designs remains in the method they arrange the backflush cycles. Because charging the beads with salt too early wastes salt and water, this is important. Recharging too late causes efficiency to fall off.

<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions.
