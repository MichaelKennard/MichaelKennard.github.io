<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
