Nevertheless, they cost a bit more than electrical designs. They likewise feature a temperature and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature level or pressure goes beyond predetermined levels. We supply gas hot water heater service, as well as electrical water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>
