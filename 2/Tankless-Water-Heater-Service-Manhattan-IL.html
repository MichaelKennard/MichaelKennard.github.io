The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for homeowners. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
