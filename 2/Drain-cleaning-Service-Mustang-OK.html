<p>Spotty meals? Circulation pipes transition to even smaller sized private service pipes, bring water to specific homes, apartment or condo buildings, stores and companies. Depending on need, these pipes range in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water enters the customer center via a water meter that tapes flow rates and water utilization for billing purposes. Private service pipelines are normally made from lead, plastic or type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, but with time they develop and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
