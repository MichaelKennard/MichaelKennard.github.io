<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Hammond IN</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work. Their responsibilities break out into two classifications: Plumbers who manage standard repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on redesigning additions and jobs.</p>
<p>In local water supply systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation happens, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The best and best type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
