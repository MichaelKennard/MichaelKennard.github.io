<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
