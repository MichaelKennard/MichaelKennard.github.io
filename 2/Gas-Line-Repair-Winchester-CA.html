I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
