<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
