<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, often simply called fitters, install and preserve pipes that may bring gases, acids, and chemicals. These pipes are mainly in production, commercial, and commercial settings. Fitters install and repair pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are developed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as gasfitters or sprinklerfitters.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
