<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair at Hoschton GA</h3>
<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is appropriate for household, commercial, and commercial applications, including the prevention of limescale build-up in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, as well as improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more cost-effective than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which should be regenerated using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that needs significant water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

Sometimes it may be necessary to filter the water prior to it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
