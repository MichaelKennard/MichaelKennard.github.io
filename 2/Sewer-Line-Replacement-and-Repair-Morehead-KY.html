<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and bigger certainly does not mean better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to lose area on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regeneration to release solidity, dirt and sediment.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
