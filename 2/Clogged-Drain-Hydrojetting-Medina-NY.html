The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
