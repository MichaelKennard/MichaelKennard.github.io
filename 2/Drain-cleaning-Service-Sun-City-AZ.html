<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or wet sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection.

Backsiphonage happens when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the public water system.
