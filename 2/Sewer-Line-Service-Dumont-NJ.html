<p>Most disposals will last between 10 and 12 years prior to requiring replacement. Signs that your disposal requires to be replaced include requiring to push the reset button often, the blades no longer chopping up the waste well or taking longer to slice up the waste, leaking from the bottom of the unit, frequent obstructions, or visible corrosion on the system itself.</p>
