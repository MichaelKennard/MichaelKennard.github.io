<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement.

All of them wanted to take a look at the scenario prior to committing to a rate, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
