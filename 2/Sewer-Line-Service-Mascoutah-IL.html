<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
