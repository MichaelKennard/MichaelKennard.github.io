<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
