Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would offer a quote over the phone.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
