<p>The next action we should carry out in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to guarantee the line is effectively flushed.</p>
