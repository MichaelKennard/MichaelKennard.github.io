<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>

When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
