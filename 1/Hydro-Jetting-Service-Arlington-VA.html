This is especially real if you have neglected tough water, which includes extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is hard to repair. Leakages often imply a new system replacement remains in order.</p>
