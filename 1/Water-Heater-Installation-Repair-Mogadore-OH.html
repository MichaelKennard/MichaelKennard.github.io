<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Mogadore OH</h3>
<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - primarily with sinks. In many cases, a sink drain problem is caused by extreme pollutants or particles inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care products or soaps. While there are numerous chemical drain cleaning choices, sometimes this can cause more damage than assistance. Anytime you discover a clogged drain, connect to Resurrection Plumbing to detect the problem and recommend the right repairs.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
