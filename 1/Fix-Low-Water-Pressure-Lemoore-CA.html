<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer covering of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce a great seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
