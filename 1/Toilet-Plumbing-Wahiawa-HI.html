<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cord connected. If this holds true, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Be sure to purchase a wiring kit with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you link the wiring harness to the disposer, guarantee the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>

We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.
