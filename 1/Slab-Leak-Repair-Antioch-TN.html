<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
