The factors for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the components may suffice if it is one of the pointed out issues. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems taking place regularly, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
