<p>As explained earlier in the article, carbon monoxide is totally odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house ought to have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the proper locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are usually offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
