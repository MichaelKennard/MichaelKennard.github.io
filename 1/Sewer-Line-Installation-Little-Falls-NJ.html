<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Little Falls NJ</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to determine and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially useful in locating a problem.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
