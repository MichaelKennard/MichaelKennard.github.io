<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
