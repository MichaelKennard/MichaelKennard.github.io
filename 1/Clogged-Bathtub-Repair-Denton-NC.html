<p>Normally, there are tank water heaters that utilize either natural gas or electricity for their fuel. Gas tank systems use almost 50% less energy, costing less to operate, than the electric range. However, they cost a bit more than electrical designs. When either temperature level or pressure goes beyond pre-programmed levels, they likewise feature a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens. We supply gas water heater service, in addition to electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>

In some cases the serial number of the assembly will be required to differentiate one design from another. It is important to know the appropriate design to ensure you get the proper repair parts.</p>
<p>All Backflow Prevention Assembly Testers (BAPTs) are required to sign up with Vepo, LLC.

For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
