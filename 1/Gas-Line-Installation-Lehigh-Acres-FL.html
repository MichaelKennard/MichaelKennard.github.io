<p>In some cases, our service technicians will advise that you replace your hot water heater rather than purchase repairs.

When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
