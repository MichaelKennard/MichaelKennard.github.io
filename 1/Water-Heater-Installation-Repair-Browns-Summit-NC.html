<p>Backflow preventers need to only be fixed when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually degraded in its performance below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
