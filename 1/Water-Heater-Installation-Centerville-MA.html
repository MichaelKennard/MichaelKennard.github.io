<p>Back-siphonage is backflow brought on by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water supply or consumer's potable water system.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water really needs it. When needed, newer systems use digital sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason only regrow. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted brine option after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be used to accomplish this, and may be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
