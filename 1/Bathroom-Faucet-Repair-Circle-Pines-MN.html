<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Deterioration can actually eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. The result of rust on a metal alloy should be examined to figure out if the part is functional or should be changed.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
