<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
