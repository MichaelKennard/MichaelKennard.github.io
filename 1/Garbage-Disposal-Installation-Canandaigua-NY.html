Customer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would offer a price quote over the phone.

See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
