<p>Backflow threatens since it can pollute the public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered queasiness and other symptoms after a contractor working on the A/C system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is thought about a testable backflow preventer, but it is likewise very uncommon. They were made so as to offer the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. When it comes to the threat, this device covers dangerous along with non-hazardous scenarios. However just as with the AVB it can not handle back pressure, only back siphonage.</p>
<p>Backpressure might occur when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly secured, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
