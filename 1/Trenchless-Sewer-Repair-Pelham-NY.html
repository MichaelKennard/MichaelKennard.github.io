<p>Waste disposal unit warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can vary in between 2 and ten years. Considering that the average lifespan of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to buy an extended guarantee. Most service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid more breakdowns, house owners need to stay up to date with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
