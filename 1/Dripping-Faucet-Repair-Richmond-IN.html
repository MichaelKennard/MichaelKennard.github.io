<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
