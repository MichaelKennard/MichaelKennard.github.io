I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
