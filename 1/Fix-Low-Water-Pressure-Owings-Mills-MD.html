<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is especially real if you have without treatment tough water, which contains harsh minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material with time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leaks often suggest a brand-new system replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin areas leak immediately and sometimes those leaks come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up requiring to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
