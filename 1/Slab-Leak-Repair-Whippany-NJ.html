<p>After getting here after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, considering that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
