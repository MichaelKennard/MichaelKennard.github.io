Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, component, or system  group is changed, a license and inspection will not be needed.

Install a hair stopper in your shower drain - The number one factor our Tewksbury drain cleaning experts are called into a house is for hair in the shower drain.

<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my community being repiped and have talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't spotted soon, obviously it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
