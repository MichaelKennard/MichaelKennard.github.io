However, it is necessary you permit our specialist plumber to have a look to guarantee it's not a bigger concern than you initially thought.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
