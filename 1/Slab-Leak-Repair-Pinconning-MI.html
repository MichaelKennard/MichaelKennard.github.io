<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Pinconning MI and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
