<p>Place the flange on the top side of the sink, and attach the fastening system on the underside (Image 1). It is useful to apply pressure on the flange from above utilizing a 2nd set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in location while connecting the fastening system listed below. Make certain the plumber's putty is noticeably exuding beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). When a complete seal has formed, eliminate the excess putty with a rag.</p>
<p>If you turn on your house's water spigots and water starts draining with a yellow-colored, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear indication that rust or sediment has actually built up in your pipes and a repiping job must remain in your near future.
