<p>We are always all set to go the extra mile to offer the most sincere, effective, professional, dependable and friendly heating contractor services available throughout Seattle. Disconnect the disposal from the flange assembly and remove it from the drain. Bought the Insinkerator from Lowes for $199 + $15 tax. Installation by a plumber cost $275, but he likewise needed to replace rusty inlet water pipes. About 1.5 hours total.</p>
<p>Next comes the metal install ring and rubber cushion mount (or cushion ring). Their proper orientation will be labeled. These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when properly fitted together hold the mount ring and disposal in location. Holding the install ring at the topmost part of the flange, work the cushion install over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion install is totally and strongly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed correctly, you must not be able to remove the cushion install without substantial pulling and stretching, and the mount ring should turn easily around it.</p>

After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
