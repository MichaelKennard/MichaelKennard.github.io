When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply.
