<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in O Fallon MO</h3>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home carries minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and components. To avoid deterioration from rust, tank are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting damaging materials. By having the anode rod checked regularly and changed as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Running out of warm water unexpectedly is something no property owner wants to experience; yet, it's a common occurrence if your water heater isn't running at complete capacity. At Air Pros U.S.A., we provide top quality water heater repair and installation to the residents of Dallas-Fort Worth, Colorado Springs, and Florida, and we will ensure you have warm water when you need it.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be kept above the assembly to allow for servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves. As soon as you suspect an issue with your sewer or water lines, call a plumber. A blockage or a break can lead to damages that are costly to repair so time is of the essence. Our professionally-trained, background-checked, and licensed plumbers will gladly respond to any concerns you have about your home's plumbing system.</p>
