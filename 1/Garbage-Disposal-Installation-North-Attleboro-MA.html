<p>The most reliable method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube.

That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and corrosion. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
