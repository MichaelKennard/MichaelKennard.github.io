<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to ruin micro-organisms and supply cleansed water. The cost is approximately the same for setting up a propane gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have natural gas go to the house. Find out which sort of gas your home currently has. Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get changed when repiped.</p>
