<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
<p>Because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become coated within, New homes developed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to destructive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
