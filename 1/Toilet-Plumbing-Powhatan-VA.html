No, it is not a regular event, however it does happen more often than you think! Often it occurs in the evening when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not advised, as this might clog the softening tank.
