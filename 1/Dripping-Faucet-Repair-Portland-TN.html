<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>
