<p>Among the most common bathroom plumbing problems to occur is a clogged toilet. In fact, a number of us keep a plunger near our toilet in case it ever need to clog.

<h3>Burlingame CA Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>We are an insured and licensed drain cleaning contractor who can clear out tough drain clogs and leave them working fresh once again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to link to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>
<p>Installing a brand-new kitchen sink includes a variety of things that ought to be done professionally to ensure your sink and drain are working appropriately. The water supply pipes need to be attached to the faucet, the drainage pipe needs to connect to the sink basin and sewer, the sink itself needs to be securely anchored to the wall and floor, and making certain the sink fits perfectly with the kitchen counter top.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If everything is ready, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
