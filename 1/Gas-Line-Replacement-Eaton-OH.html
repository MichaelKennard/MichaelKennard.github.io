<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can develop a suction effect and draw possible contaminants into the potable (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are commonly discovered in most houses. Their components are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
