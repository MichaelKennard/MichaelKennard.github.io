<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
