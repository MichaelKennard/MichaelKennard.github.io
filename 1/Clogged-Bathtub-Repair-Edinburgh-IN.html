You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
