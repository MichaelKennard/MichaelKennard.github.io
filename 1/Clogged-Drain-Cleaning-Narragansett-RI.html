<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
