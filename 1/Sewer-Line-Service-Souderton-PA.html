<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
