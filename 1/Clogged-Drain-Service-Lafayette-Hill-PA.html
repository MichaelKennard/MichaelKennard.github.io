<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
