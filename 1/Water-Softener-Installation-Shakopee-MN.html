<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Shakopee MN</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
<p>Extreme rust, or rusty water, could imply the tank will need to be changed. As water heater age, sediment buildup and wears away the inside of the tank and rust can develop allowing it into the main water supply. For the most part, this suggests a water heater replacement.
