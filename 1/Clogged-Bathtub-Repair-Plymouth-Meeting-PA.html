<p>When picking the correct system protection there are several considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be looked at on an individual basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the threat that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to meet that particular risk or need.
