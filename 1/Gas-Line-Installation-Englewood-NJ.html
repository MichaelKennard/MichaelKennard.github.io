<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just removes firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll discover that water runs to refill the bowl. However, in a properly working toilet, the water should stop running when the bowl is filled to its appropriate capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are incredibly wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>Older toilets generally utilize 3.5 gallons or more per flush, particularly if they were made prior to 1994. Newer designs just utilize 1.6 gallons per flush while still providing the very same flushing power. More recent toilet designs are environmentally-friendly and have a double flushing system which only uses 0.9 gallons per flush. Tankless water heaters: These water heaters heat much faster than traditional water heaters. They also take up less area given that they do not require a tank.</p>
