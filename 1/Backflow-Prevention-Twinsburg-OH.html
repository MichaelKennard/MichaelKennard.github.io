So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all types of work.

Hanging on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
