<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
