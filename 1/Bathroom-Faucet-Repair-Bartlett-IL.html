For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
