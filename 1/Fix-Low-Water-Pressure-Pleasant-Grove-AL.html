<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was frequently blocking. They came out and dug a new path for the line connected it to the sewer and everything. It was completely hot and I actually value their effort to permit us to use our water centers again. Had an excellent experience with these folks. I highly advise their services.</p>
<p>Two designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health risks but works against back-siphonage just.</p>
