<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
