<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they would not take responsibility if it leaked now since of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, given that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
