<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If permitted to return to the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
