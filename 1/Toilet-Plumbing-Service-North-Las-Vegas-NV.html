<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in numerous parts of the plumbing system, most frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation concerns or perhaps stop a fixture from flowing entirely. The next common concern that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it decreases the readily available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with potable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Traditionally, the cost savings have been based largely on lowering chemical and cleaning agent costs.
