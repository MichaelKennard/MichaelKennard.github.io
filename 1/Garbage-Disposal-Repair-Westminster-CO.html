<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Westminster CO</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer checked on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
