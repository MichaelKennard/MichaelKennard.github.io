<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some hot water heater promote functions that decrease mineral scale buildup by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Functions such as these add cost, and aren't that reliable. Your best strategy is to get the water heater with the 12 year service warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per direct foot.

In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
