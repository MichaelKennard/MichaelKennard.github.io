<p>Concealed water leaks are typically stressful and have Potentially Major Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need somewhat various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.
