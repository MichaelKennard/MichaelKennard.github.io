<p>Most residential houses have roof rain gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water away from the house. When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that circulation to municipal storm drains or street seamless gutters, they sometimes become clogged with tree roots and particles.

<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>

For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
