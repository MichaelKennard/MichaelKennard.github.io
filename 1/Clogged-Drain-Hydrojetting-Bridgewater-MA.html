Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" salt ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of firmness.</p>
<p>If the leaking hot water heater is within the home, it is nest to immediately run the water off to the heater and schedule a visit with a plumber to prevent flooding inside of the home. Before we start any work, Accurate Leak and Line will prepare a schematic diagram that will draw up the damage and the work required to replace the pipe and offer a price quote of the cost of the replacement.</p>
