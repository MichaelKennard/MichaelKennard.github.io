<p>We utilize quality items. In many instances, we try to use flexible carbon steel to transfer natural gas from the exterior gas source to appliances. Versatile steel removes the need to cut and piece individual segments of piping together which reduces capacity for gas leaks. Carbon steel has ingredients that can stand up to specific conditions during element exposure. Tracer wire is typically used with versatile carbon steel to alert the gas company when a leak occurs. We can ensure that these lines are working properly.</p>
