<p>When deciding on the correct system defense there are a number of factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a specific basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire defense system are developed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to fulfill that particular risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a very various fire security system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
