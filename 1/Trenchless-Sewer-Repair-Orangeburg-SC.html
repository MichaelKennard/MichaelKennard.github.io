<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on a very low flow or static circulation condition may trigger problem leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the perpetrator. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
