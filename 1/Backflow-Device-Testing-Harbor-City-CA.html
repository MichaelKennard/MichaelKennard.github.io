<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the potable system supplying the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then get in the safe and clean water system. The very best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
