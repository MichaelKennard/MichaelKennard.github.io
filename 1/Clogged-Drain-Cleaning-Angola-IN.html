<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>A water softener need to be set up as close to the water's point of entry into your home as possible. This guarantees most of your plumbing and devices are reaping the benefits of carrying the softened water.

You will wish to install the softener in a dry, level area, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near to the water's main line, an electrical outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the brine option from the regeneration cycle.</p>
