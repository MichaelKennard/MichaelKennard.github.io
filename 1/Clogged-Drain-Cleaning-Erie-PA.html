<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed effectively, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

<p>After arriving after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now due to the fact that of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, given that I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
