<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord connected. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to acquire a circuitry kit with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you link the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
