<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
