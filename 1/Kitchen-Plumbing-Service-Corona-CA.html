<p>The repair professional need to have the ability to determine the lots of different makers and the specific designs produced throughout the years. Some models might appear similar on the outdoors but could need various repair parts on the within, so the repair specialist must have the ability to determine the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. Often the serial number of the assembly will be required to distinguish one model from another. It is important to understand the proper design to assure you get the right repair parts.</p>
