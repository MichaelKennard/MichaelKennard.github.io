<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day.
