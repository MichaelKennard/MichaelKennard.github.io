<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home. Even if the problem stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the professionals to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
