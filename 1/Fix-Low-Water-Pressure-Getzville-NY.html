<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
