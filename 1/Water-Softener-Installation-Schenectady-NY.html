<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
