<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Cicero IL</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You should never ever put glass, metal, or plastic down your disposal. In most cases we find silverware jammed in the disposal and it can be damaging to your system. Remember, the waste disposal unit is a hassle-free method to eliminate plate scrapings and assorted soft foods. If a repair will not correct the problem, and you need a bathroom or kitchen sink or fixture replacement, we can install your new sink or fixture, and we can offer guidance on the very best choices to accommodate your particular home or service needs.</p>
