For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
