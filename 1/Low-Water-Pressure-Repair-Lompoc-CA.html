<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in several drains at once in your home, then that normally suggests that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>No house owner wants to deal with inefficient plumbing, especially when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your homes plumbing goes beyond simply the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that links to them. The majority of significant plumbing problems normally happen on the main line, and it's best to avoid them as much as possible. Harmed sewer lines can result in restrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>
