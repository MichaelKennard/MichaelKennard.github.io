<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab.

<p>Frequent leaks: Leaks originating from your hot water heater are never a good indication.

<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
