<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
