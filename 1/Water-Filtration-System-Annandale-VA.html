<p>Sinkholes don't just happen in your lawn, regrettably, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to discover out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's foundation.

In this case, you'll need expert plumbers in addition to foundation repair experts.</p>

Gradually, dirt, particles, hair, and numerous other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or efficiently, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously backing up. It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this occurs.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience blockages in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that typically indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
