<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>Because the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become covered inside, New homes constructed with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to destructive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
