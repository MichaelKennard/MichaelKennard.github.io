<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Lindale TX</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of elements that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control. Thus, considering all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
