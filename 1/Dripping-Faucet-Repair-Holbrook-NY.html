The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
