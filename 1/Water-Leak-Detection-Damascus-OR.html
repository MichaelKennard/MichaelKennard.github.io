<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and ecological policies. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon before it can occur, avoiding polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to avoid backflow range from the reasonably easy to the complex and extremely sophisticated.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
