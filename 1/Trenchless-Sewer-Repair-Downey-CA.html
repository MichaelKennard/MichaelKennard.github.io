Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
