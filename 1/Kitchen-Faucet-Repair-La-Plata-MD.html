<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the property or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit plans with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Offense will be sent. Lawbreakers will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately result in criminal and civil procedures and actions, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
