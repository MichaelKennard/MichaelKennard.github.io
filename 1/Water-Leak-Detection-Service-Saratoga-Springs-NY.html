The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm guarantee that the special function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This may or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
