<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube.

That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration.
