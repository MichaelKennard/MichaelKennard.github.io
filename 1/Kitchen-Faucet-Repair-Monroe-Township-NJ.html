<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Monroe Township NJ</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
