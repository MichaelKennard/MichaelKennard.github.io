I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
