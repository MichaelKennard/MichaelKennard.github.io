<p>Handling a leaky faucet or sputtery waste disposal unit is never ever fun, but putting off repairing it for too long can trigger water damage or increase your water bill.

In one- and two-family residences, AWWA mentions that backflow preventers are not needed on lawn sprinkler constructed of authorized drinkable material and designed to stream water, so it doesn't stagnate.

<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is an essential kitchen device in a lot of houses today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can manage almost any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the danger of drain clogs.</p>

Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
