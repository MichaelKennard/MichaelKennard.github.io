<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least pricey, but also the least reliable alternative. These devices are not developed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one should be installed at every control valve.

When one has actually stopped working, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to find.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
