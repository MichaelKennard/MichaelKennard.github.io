<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just tough to identify, they're likewise capable of triggering some major damage. Pinhole leaks, for instance, are so small that they only launch a couple of beads at a time. That's far too little to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that may warn of a leak in the system.

There are several faucet styles, so you may not be able to tell what to replace up until you've done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or employ a plumber, this would be a good time to think of whether you wish to update the faucet with a new design.</p>
