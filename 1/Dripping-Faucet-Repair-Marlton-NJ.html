<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up corrosion Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control. Hence, considering all these elements, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
