Furthermore, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can restrict air flow and make it difficult to use several of your gas-powered devices like the clothes dryer or stove. Based upon research carried out by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Advantages Research Study, 2011.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
