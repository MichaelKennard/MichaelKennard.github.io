<p>When the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly.
