Knowing if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be helpful when negotiating the sale of a home. There are so many kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's a good idea to get a whole home plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Repairs are too expensive. If your commode requires numerous repairs, it's a better use of your money to buy a brand name new one. Multiple repairs are pricey, but they also indicate stopping working elements within your toilet. Save yourself the headache and replace a toilet that requires many repairs before it breaks down entirely. The Plumbing Inspection section also keeps an active backflow security program in cooperation with the Greater Cincinnati Water Functions where all backflow preventers are examined, tagged, tested and incorporated into the GCWW database for yearly testing.</p>
