That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Know that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, however for those on a rigorous sodium-free diet plan it may be excessive. If this doesn't work, you might need to replace among your toilet's elements, generally the flapper. There may also be a concern with the chain connected to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
