<p>Noticeable smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your house or company area, provide us a call. That odor might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, launches sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will frequently need to be changed rather than repaired. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or giving off nasty smells.</p>

Soon, your water and sewage will be flowing easily once again and you will not need to stress over drains and sewer lines any longer.</p>

To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire house when you find a leak.</p>
