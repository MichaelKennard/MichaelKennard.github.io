While there are numerous chemical drain cleaning options, in some cases this can trigger more damage than help. Anytime you find a clogged drain, connect to Resurrection Plumbing to detect the problem and suggest the right repairs.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
