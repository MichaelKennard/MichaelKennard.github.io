<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our clients is kept devoid of harmful contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can happen through a process known as backflow.</p>

This can take place at any time, such as throughout a water pipe break or throughout a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
