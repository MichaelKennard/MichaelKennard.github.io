<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Villanova PA</h3>
<p>Like any household home appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate securely and efficiently. Routine water heater maintenance can likewise extend the life of the appliance and help prevent unanticipated leaks or other problems.

<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
