<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
