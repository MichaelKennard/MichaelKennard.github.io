<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Spanaway WA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>There are several signs to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and components in your house have actually been shut off. 3) The water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to greater gas and water bills, often really quickly.</p>
