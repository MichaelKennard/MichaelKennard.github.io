<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter scenarios, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task. Often, the basements are so loaded with sewage, I can not securely go into the basement and operate until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is typically cleaned. I 'd love to publish some pictures of this. Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>
<p>Any location water runs through home. This includes sinks, toilets, tubs, lines, and pipes. At this time, the pro will try to find leakages and damaged pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will inspect water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms.
