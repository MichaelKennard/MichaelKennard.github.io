<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
