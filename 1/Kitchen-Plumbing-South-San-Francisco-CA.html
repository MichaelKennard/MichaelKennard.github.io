<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at South San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of rust control. Therefore, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
