<p>Visible smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or throughout your house or business location, provide us a call. That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, launches sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or discharging nasty smells, you'll know this.</p>
