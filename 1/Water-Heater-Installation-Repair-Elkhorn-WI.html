<p>A lot of toilets used today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, meaning they use the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system. Just recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in increasingly more homes. This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing system to suck the water into the bowl and down into the sewage systems. A downside of this device is that it's much more hard to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>

It is very important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
