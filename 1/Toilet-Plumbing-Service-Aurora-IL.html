<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Due to the fact that they will be on a certification test, I mention them only.</p>

<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll observe that water runs to fill up the bowl. Nevertheless, in an effectively working toilet, the water should stop running when the bowl is filled to its suitable capacity. If your toilet continues to run, chances are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow. These leaks are extremely wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up traveling through the overflow.</p>
