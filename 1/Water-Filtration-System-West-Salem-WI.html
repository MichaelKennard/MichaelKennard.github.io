<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
