An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>

Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
