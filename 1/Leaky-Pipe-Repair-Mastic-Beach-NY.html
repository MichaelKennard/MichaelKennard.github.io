<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Mastic Beach NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
