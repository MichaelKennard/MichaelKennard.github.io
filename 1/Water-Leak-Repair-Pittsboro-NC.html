<p>The typical life expectancy of an electric water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain path, small pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet a larger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
