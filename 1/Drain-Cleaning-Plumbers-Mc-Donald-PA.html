<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
