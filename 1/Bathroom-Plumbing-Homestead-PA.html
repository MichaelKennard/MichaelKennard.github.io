When a new home is constructed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be installed properly and to local, state, and federal code.

Lots of insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 homeowners' policy particularly leaves out "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended time period."

See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
