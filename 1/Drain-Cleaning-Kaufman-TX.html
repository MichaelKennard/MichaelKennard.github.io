When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
