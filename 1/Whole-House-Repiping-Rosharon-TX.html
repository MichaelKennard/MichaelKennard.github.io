<p>Be aware that softened water includes trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the exact same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet it might be excessive. If this does not work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's components, generally the flapper. There might likewise be an issue with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up correctly, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
