<p>Aside from water dripping and the occasional creak, your pipes ought to not be making any odd sounds, especially not ones loud enough to keep you up in the evening. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a guaranteed sign of a larger issue. Have your pipes inspected as soon as possible so you don't wind up with a significant leak.</p>
