<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
