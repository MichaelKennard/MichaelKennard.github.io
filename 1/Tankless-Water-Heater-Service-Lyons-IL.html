<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Lyons IL</h3>
<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
