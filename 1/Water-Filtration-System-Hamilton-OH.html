<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work.
