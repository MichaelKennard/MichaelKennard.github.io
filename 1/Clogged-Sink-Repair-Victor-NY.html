<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
