<p>Inappropriate drainage slope: Drainage pipes are developed to take waste water far from a house and provide it to the city's sewer system. A lot of do this using the power of gravity; pipes are sloped to drain water towards the street.

However, if the pipe is continuously leaking and requires regular repairs, we would advise repiping.
