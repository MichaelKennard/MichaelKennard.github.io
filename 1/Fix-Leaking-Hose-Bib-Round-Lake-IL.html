<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
