A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
