<p>Do you need to have your house's plumbing system took a look at?

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
