<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Belmont NC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak immediately and in some cases those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
