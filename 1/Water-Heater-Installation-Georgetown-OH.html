<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
