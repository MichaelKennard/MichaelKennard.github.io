<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs.

It is essential to go out in front of any problems as quick as possible. The quicker you react to a problem, the much better opportunity you'll need to conserve money and time on hot water heater services.</p>
