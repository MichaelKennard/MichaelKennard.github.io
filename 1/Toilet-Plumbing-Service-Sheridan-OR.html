<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
