<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
